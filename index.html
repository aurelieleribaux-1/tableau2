        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In recent years, the automotive industry has witnessed a significant shift towards sustainable transportation solutions, driven by concerns over environmental sustainability and the need to reduce carbon emissions (European Environment Agency, 2016).
        According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), road transport electrification on a global scale is expected to unlock substantial emission reductions in the coming decades (IEA, 2024). By 2035, the switch to electric vehicles (EVs) is projected to avoid over 2 gigatons (Gt) of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on a well-to-wheels basis. While there are concerns about additional emissions from electricity generation for EVs, the net savings from transitioning to electric vehicles far outweigh any potential drawbacks.
        The introductory dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of EV adoption in Europe, highlighting key insights and trends based on the latest data. The left side features a map showing the production share of EVs as a percentage of projected EV production by 2027, with a color gradient from bright orange to bright blue indicating low to high market share. Notably, Norway, and Europe in general exhibit high EV production shares. The right side highlights Europe and displays a bar chart comparing the percentage of EV and non-EV car sales in 2023, with Norway leading in adoption, followed closely by the Netherlands. Users can interact with the dashboard to highlight EV or non-EV sales, or view both for a comprehensive comparison.</p>

            <h2>EV sales in the world</h2>
            <p>Previous visualizations showed the projected ev production in 2027 in the world as well as the EV and non-EV car sales in Europe in the year 2023. It is also useful for the public to see and policymakers to be informed by how the EV sales worldwide change over time, therefore predicting the trend in the following years. Although the information provided is for the worldwide EV sales, each country can still gain insight and adopt their own policies locally. The graph shows the EV sales from 2017 to 2022, indicating a clear rising trend in the sales over the years. In 2022 the sales worldwide has reached 10 million. In the following visualizations we will delve into the reasons for this uprising trend and provide more detailed analysis for the information hidden behind the data.</p>

            <h2>Government spending on EV</h2>
            <p>The visualization in these two graphs show how the government spending is increasing overall in past years. One could easily rationalize that with more money people are more willing to purchase EV, therefore causing the general rising trend in the EV sales worldwide. However, the average spending per EV refutes this saying by demonstrating a downward trend. Together with the previous visualization users could notice that with less incentive given for one EV by the government, the overall sales of EV has still been increasing in the past few years, suggesting that monetary factors are not, or at least not the only factors influencing the EV sales.</p>

            <h2>Reasons for people' EV purchase</h2>
            <p>This visualization reveals the fundamental reasons concerning people’s purchase willingness of EV. On the left side the graph describes the reasons inhibiting purchase of EV. It is evident that the worry about the lack of charging stations in the city takes up the first place whereas the lack of charging infrastructure at work or home is less of a concern. On the contrary, the graph on the right illustrates the reasons motivating the purchase of EV. It is also interesting to see that the monetary incentive, which one may assume to be the most influential factor, only takes the third place in the middle. While environmental concerns are the most motivating factor encouraging people’s purchase. And in general all the factors can be categorized to 4 types: environmental concern, monetraty incentives, charging infrustracture and upfront costs.</p>

            <h2>Financial incentive for EV purchase in selected European countries</h2>
            <p>After consideration, we opted for 4 countries that are representative in Europe to make instructions for the policymakers to speed up the transformation in Europe. As a forerunner, Norway is chosen for its high EV adoption as illustrated in the beginning. Belgium and the Netherlands are also chosen since the Netherlands have a lot in common with Belgium while taking up a much higher proportion of EV sales than Belgium. Spain is also chosen as a southern European country and for its rich data availability.</p>

            <h2>Visualization 3</h2>
            <p>Previous studies have proved that charging infrastructure is considered a key and indispensable factor in the use and popularization of electric vehicles [ 1 ]. The construction of a suitable charging network can effectively improve the satisfaction of electric vehicle users [ 2 ]. By investigating the relationship between EV market share and selected variables in 30 countries, Sierzchula et al [ 3 ] found that there is a significant positive correlation between charging infrastructure and a country's EV market share.Giansoldati et al [ 4 ] found that the availability of charging infrastructure as well as charging infrastructure availability was a key reason. [ 5 ] examined the barriers to EV penetration and identified charging infrastructure as a major barrier to the promotion of EVs in Italy.
For this part of the study, we have 2 charts, where Figure 2 represents the number of high-speed charging posts per 1000 people and Figure 1 represents the number of total public charging posts per 1000 people (both high-speed and low-speed charging posts are included). As two countries with high EV ratios, both in terms of number and quality of charging posts, Norway and the Netherlands are much higher than both Belgium and Spain.
Interestingly, Figure 1 shows a higher density of charging piles in the Netherlands than in Norway. In contrast, the ev share is higher in Norway than in the Netherlands. We think that the difference in the number of high-speed charging piles might explain this difference. This is because in general high-speed charging piles and low-speed charging piles tend to target different customer needs. Specifically, low-speed charging piles may be more able to meet daily commuting needs, such as charging during the workday, which is less sensitive to charging speed requirements, and which tends to account for a larger portion of customers whose main goal is daily commuting. High-speed chargers, on the other hand, tend to be more attractive to customers who travel long distances, and are often installed in locations such as highway service areas. We therefore believe that a possible reason for the difference between Norway and the Netherlands is that Norway better meets the requirements of customers who have a need to travel long distances.
Therefore, we believe that, contrary to the previous impression that simply increasing the density of charging posts will not increase the share of EV sales indefinitely (e.g., in the Netherlands), increasing the number of high-speed charging posts may be an effective measure to increase the share of EV sales while increasing the density of charging posts to satisfy the main needs of vehicle owners.

            <h2>Recharging Cost</h2>
            <p>For consumers and potential buyers, one important factor is the recharging price. One recharging session can consist of several components: Private recharging price, that is, the electricity price when you recharge the EVs at home. When recharging in public places, it involves two kinds of fees: public AC (alternating current) recharging, which is usually slow and cheaper, and fast but more expensive public DC (direct current) recharging. Another option is to subscribe to eMobility Service Providers (MSPs), which involves subscription fee.  The chart below shows these components in Norway, Spain, Nederland, and Belgium. An interactive dashboard is also shown, so that users can get an estimated monthly recharging cost based on their own monthly kilometer driven, average vehicle consumption, composition of different recharging methods. Please note that additional costs may apply and the prices are only indicative.</p>

    <!-- Policy Factor Section -->
    <div class="text-above-viz">
        <h2>Policy Factor</h2>
        <p>One critical factor influencing the adoption of EVs is policy. Policies have played a significant role in steering corporate strategies towards electrification and enabling consumer uptake. The EU has set a binding target for 100% zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales by 2035 for all member states. However, individual member states can set their own earlier targets to promote the early adoption of EVs. Among the four countries selected for discussion, Norway has set the earliest goal, aiming to achieve 100% ZEV sales for light-duty vehicles by 2025. Similarly, the Netherlands has set an earlier ZEV goal for 2030, ahead of the EU’s compulsory target of 2035. Belgium and Spain, on the other hand, follow the EU’s deadline, aiming to achieve 100% ZEV sales by 2035. These policy differences among countries contribute to the current differences in EV adoption rates. Norway and the Netherlands, with their earlier deadlines, have higher EV adoption rates compared to Belgium and Spain.</p>
